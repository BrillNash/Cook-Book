                    <div class="list-container padd-15">
                        <ol class="padd-15">
                            <li class="padd-10">In a bowl, whisk together the flour and salt and set aside for now.</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Combine the cold cubed butter and the sugar in the bowl of a large stand mixer fitted with a paddle 
                                attachment. Beat them on medium speed just until they're mixed together and there are no longer any chunks of 
                                butter. The key is to get a homogenous texture, but not beat until it's light and fluffy—we don't want to beat 
                                too much air into the dough, because that will cause the cookies to spread!</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Add the rose water or rose flavoring, and one egg, and beat to combine. 
                                Add the second egg and beat until it's incorporated.</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Stop the mixer and add the flour, and mix on low speed until most of the flour is incorporated and 
                                just a few streaks remain. Pull the petals off the rose and finely chop them into small pieces. Add the rose petals 
                                to the bowl, and finish mixing the dough with a spatula, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl. Wrap the dough 
                                in plastic wrap and chill for an hour in the refrigerator.</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Dust your work surface and rolling pin with a light layear of. Roll the dough out until it's a 
                                bit more than 1/4-inch thick. Cut heart shapes out of the dough, dusting the cutter with flour when necessary to 
                                ensure clean cuts. Re-roll the scraps and cut out more hearts, until you've used all the dough. This recipe yields 
                                about 34 3-inch hearts.</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Place the cookies on parchment-covered baking sheets. Chill the sheets in the freezer while you preheat 
                                the oven to 350 F. Bake at 350 for about 10-12 minutes, rotating halfway through, until the cookies lose the raw shine in 
                                the middle and just start to take on color along the very edges—they shouldn't have much color at all! Cool the cookies 
                                completely before decorating.</li>

                    <h2 class="marg-15">How to Make the Decorations</h2>
                    <div class="list-container padd-15">
                        <ol class="padd-15">
                            <li class="padd-10">Dust your work surface and rolling pin with powdered sugar, and roll the fondant out until it is very 
                                thin, less than 1/8-inch thick. Use the same cookie cutter that you used before, and cut out the same number of hearts as 
                                you have cookies. (Or make an extra one or two in case of breakage!)</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Transfer the cookies to sheets of waxed paper or parchment, since this next part can get a bit 
                                messy. Put a drop of pink color in a small bowl and a drop of purple color in a separate small bowl. Fill a third 
                                small bowl with water. Add a bit of water to the pink and purple bowl, and mix them up so you have diluted colors. 
                                Now it's time to experiment!</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Use food-safe paintbrushes to decorate the fondant hearts. Try brushing them all over with a layer of 
                                light pink or purple, then going back and adding additional color to saturate certain areas. You can also paint just 
                                parts of the hearts with streaks of light color, or dip the paintbrush in straight food coloring and touch that to the 
                                fondant to get bright patches of color. You can dab a paper towel on portions of the fondant to remove the color, letting 
                                some of the white underneath show through. Finally, you can flick some color onto the hearts to give it a speckled, 
                                painterly appearance. If you want to experiment, try mixing some food coloring with vodka and use the same painting 
                                techniques—I found that water was best for thin washes of color, but vodka was great for blending the colors and having 
                                them bleed out a little bit. Just experiment and have fun!</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">After you paint the hearts, the tops will be quite wet and will need an overnight period to dry 
                                before you can eat them. However, they should be transferred onto the cookies before they harden, so paint the tops 
                                of your cookies with a thin layer of light corn syrup, then carefully place a heart on top of each cookie. Let them 
                                sit at room temperature overnight, until the fondant is dry and not sticky to the touch. Once they are fully dry, 
                                these cookies can be stored in an airtight container between sheets of waxed paper or parchment paper at room 
                                temperature.</li>
