                    <div class="list-container padd-15">
                        <ol class="padd-15">
                            <li class="padd-10">Make the reduced strawberry puree and allow it to cool completely. See note. You can make it a few 
                                days ahead of time and store it covered in the refrigerator or cover and freeze it for up to 3 months. Thaw before 
                                using in the recipe.</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper 
                                rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. 
                                (If it's helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together 
                                on high speed until smooth and creamed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a 
                                rubber spatula as needed. Beat in the egg whites on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Then beat in the 
                                sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on 
                                low speed, add the dry ingredients until just incorporated. With the mixer still running on low, slowly pour in 
                                the milk *just* until combined. Do not overmix. Whisk in 1/2 cup of reduced strawberry puree, making sure there are 
                                no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick. Stir in food coloring, if desired. (I use 1 
                                small drop.)</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 24-25 minutes or until the cakes are baked 
                                through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it is done. 
                                Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting 
                                and assembling.</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Make the frosting: Using a blender or food processor, process the freeze-dried strawberries into 
                                a powdery crumb. You should have around 1/2 cup crumbs. Set aside. In a large bowl using a hand-held or stand mixer 
                                fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese for 1 minute on high speed until completely smooth 
                                and creamy. Beat in the butter until combined. Add the confectioners' sugar, strawberry powder, 1 Tablespoon milk, 
                                and vanilla and beat on medium-high speed until combined and creamy. Add 1 more Tablespoon of milk to slightly thin 
                                out, if desired. Taste, then add a pinch of salt if needed. Yields about 3 cups of frosting.</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Assemble and frost: First, using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the 
                                cakes to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!). Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or 
                                serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread the remaining frosting all over 
                                the top and sides. Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake keep its shape when 
                                cutting- it could slightly fall apart without time in the fridge.</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <h2 class="marg-15">Notes:</h2>
                    <div class="list-container padd-15">
                        <ol class="padd-15">
                            <li class="padd-10">Make Ahead Instructions: The cake layers can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly at room 
                                temperature overnight. Likewise, the frosting can be prepared then covered and refrigerated overnight. Light it 
                                sit at room temperature to slightly soften for 10 minutes before assembling and frosting. Frosted cake or unfrosted 
                                cake layers can be frozen up to 2 months-3. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before 
                                decorating/serving.</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Cake Flour: I strongly suggest using cake flour in this recipe. It's sold right next to the 
                                all-purpose flour in the baking aisle. And you use it a lot in my recipes!</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Whole Milk: If needed, buttermilk works in its place. I don't recommend a lower fat milk.</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Where to Buy Freeze-Dried Strawberries? I always find them in my regular grocery store in the 
                                dried fruit aisle. Wegmans, Giant, Trader Joe's and Target carries them. Keep your eyes peeled- they're more 
                                commonly found that you think! Do not use the chewy/gummy dried strawberries. You need FREEZE-dried strawberries 
                                which grind into a powder. If you can't find them anywhere, just leave them out of the frosting and add another 
                                1/2 cup of confectioners' sugar.</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Reduced Strawberry Puree: puree 1 lb of rinsed and hulled strawberries. You should have a little over 1 cup. 
                                Stirring occasionally, simmer the puree over low-medium heat until you're left with 1/2 cup or a little over 1/2 cup. 
                                This takes at least 25-35 minutes, but could take longer depending on your pan or how juicy your strawberries were. 
                                *Do not add sugar or anything to the puree or reduced puree- it's just pure strawberries. I always make the reduced puree 
                                the day before so it has plenty of time to cool down. I cover and place in the refrigerator overnight. Use 1/2 cup in the cake. 
                                Allow to cool completely before using in cake batter. Make sure it's room temperature when adding to the batter. 
                                You can make the reduced puree ahead of time and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw, bring to room temperature, then use in 
                                the recipe. Discard any leftovers or spoon on ice cream/yogurt/add to smoothie. Yum! You can use frozen strawberries, but 
                                they will take longer to reduce even if you thaw them first.</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">9x13 Inch Cake: Simply pour the batter into a greased 9x13 inch pan and bake for 40 minutes or until 
                                a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Cupcakes: Fill cupcake pans 2/3 full with batter. Bake for 20-22 minutes. Makes 2 and 1/2 dozen 
                                cupcakes. For 14-15 cupcakes, follow my strawberry cupcakes recipe, which is adapted from this strawberry cake.</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">Food Coloring: If you want, you can add 1-2 small drops of pink or red food coloring for a lovely 
                                pink shade to the baked cake. I add 1 small drop of pink gel food coloring.</li>
                            <li class="padd-10">No Cream Cheese in Frosting: If you'd like to skip the cream cheese in the frosting, use my 
                                strawberry buttercream recipe instead. You'll have enough for a thin layer of frosting, but you can 1.5x the recipe 
                                for a thicker layer.</li>
